**My interest for the Universe had me creating a blog dedicated to Jupiter.**

## Description

I created this website/blog for my Noroff Exam 2022. The idea for the theme, which obviously is Jupiter, came from my interest of the Universe. Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system, and an obvious choice for the first feature, with the idea that the rest of the planets will be featured in future projects.

The blog will be a great source of factual information about the planet, where visitor's can learn everything there is to know about said planet.

## Built With
